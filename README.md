# Notify Me
This is a gem that provides simple and generic notifications that can have 0
or more actions associated with them.

## Usage:

    class User < ActiveRecord::Base
        has_many_notifications
        ...
    end
    
    class Task < ActiveRecord::Base
        ...
    end
    
    class TaskSwap < ActiveRecord::Base
        belongs_to :from, class_name: "User"
        belongs_to :to,     class_name: "User"
        belongs_to :task
    
        def accept_swap(action)
            ...
        end
    
        def reject_swap(action)
            ...
        end
    end
    
A user wants to request a task swap

    swap_task = SwapTask.create(...)
    notification = NotifyMe::Notification.create(message: "John Doe would like to swap tasks with you")
    user.notifications << notification
    
    notification.actions.create(notification: notification, commandable: swap_task, action: "accept_swap", name: "Accept")
    notification.actions.create(notification: notification, commandable: swap_task, action: "reject_swap", name: "Reject")
    
Likely in some controller somewhere

    action = Action.find(params[:id])
    action.run_action() # if this was the action created above, this would call swap_task.accept_swap(action)
